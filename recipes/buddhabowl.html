        <p>Inspired by Mexican flavors, this bowl is great for those who like it spicy. The chipotle maple pecans make an excellent topping while adding some extra protein. The veggies and beans bake in the oven for about 25 minutes, and altogether this bowl takes about 40 minutes to make and one recipe serves 2.</p>
